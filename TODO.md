- Add potion charge capability
- Add tier effects to classes
- make 2 more vision tiers with appopriately difficult recipes (gather stuff from all over the world to encourage exploration)
- Perhaps figure out 1 or 2 new classes that don't have to do with combat
- Make a main level stat that increases max hp and maybe some other stuff
- Make mobs stronger the further they spawn from 0, 0
  - Do it in layers of about 500 blocks each, and make each layer significantly harder than the previous one.
This way it feels like an event to proceed to the next ring
  - Implement level probabilities
  - Figure out level ranges for each ring (should legendary t0 be common t1 or bigger/smaller gap) I think either slightly overlapping or continuous
  - Maybe just make the entire GME thing but better
  - Do this with mob level stats
  - Players get more main level xp from higher level mobs
- Include main level/xp stat in save/restore
- Add item/enchantment that prevents item loss on death
- Add loot so you want to go exploring
    - material drops from mobs
    - PlayerEntity.inventory.add()?
