- below bug is in onplayerbrewpotionevent, it doesnt add an entry for a player that already has one
- Fix bug where picking up 1 potion from a brewing stand and then shiftclicking the other pots with the one pot on cursor doesnt add charges to the one pot after putting in inventory
- Add special stat bonuses to the ender dragon and wither
- Make dragon fight harder somehow, maybe empower endermen in the end
- Add weapons/armor/enchantments to make melee/archery more exciting
- Maybe an enchanter class
- Perhaps figure out 1 or 2 new classes that don't have to do with combat
- Add wrapping armor and health bars as dependencies
- With Patchouli, add a book that describes level/tier effects
- Add effect descriptions to potions
- Add item/enchantment that prevents item loss on death
